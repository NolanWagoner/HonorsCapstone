  Welcome to the CyberPsych app! This app was made using a combination of psychology and cyber security research to improve the online security of you, the user.
  No information is collected by this app as all data will come from the survey in the google form <a href="https://forms.gle/m1QcSpM6WbAxa7Nz8" target="_blank">linked here</a>
  or on the survey button below. If you have not done so yet, please fill out the first part of the survey. When you finish using the application, you can fill out
  the post-App page and submit. Thank you for your willingness to participate in my honors capstone project!
